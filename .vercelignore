# Backend-specific Vercel ignore

# Source files are required for build output on Vercel
# NOTE: dist/ must NOT be ignored - it's needed for serverless function

# IMPORTANT: api/index.ts is a serverless function - Vercel compiles it automatically
# Do NOT compile api/ with TypeScript - it's handled by Vercel
# Do NOT ignore api/ directory - Vercel needs it
